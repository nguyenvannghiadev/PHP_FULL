    <h2><b>I like to go swimming in the summer.</b></h2>
    <p>Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining
        <br>
        and the air is warm, you will find
        me dipping into my backard pool. It's not an
        <br>
        impressive pool, only three feet deep, but it's me.</p>
    <p>There are three reasons I like to swim:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I got lots of exercise</li>
        <li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
        <li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun</li>
    </ul>
